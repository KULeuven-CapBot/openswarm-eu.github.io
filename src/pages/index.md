<p>
The [OpenSwarm](https://openswarm.eu/) (Orchestration and Programming ENergy-aware and collaborative Swarms With AI-powered Reliable Methods) project seeks to revolutionize data-driven systems with low-power wireless technology, focusing on three pillars: 
- efficient networking and management of smart nodes, 
- collaborative energy-aware Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 
- energy-aware swarm programming. 

Results are consolidated in the open-source software "OpenSwarm," validated on 1,000 node testbeds, and applied to proof-of-concept cases in renewable energy, environmental monitoring, industrial health, and mobility.
