# Accoustic Classification Demo

**Description**: An example application that utilized the distributed swarm intelligence algorithm in order to collect acoustic samples from multiple sources (laptop, smartphone, â€¦). The different observations are fused and acoustic classification tasks can be carried out on the fused observations.

* **Primary Functionality**: Demo application.
* **Target**: Server / PC
* **Task**: T3.3
* **Responsible**: Matthias Hutsebaut-Buysse

# Overview

This repository contains a practical example of the [swarm intelligence sensor-fusion algorithm](/docs/codebase/capabilities/non_ros/swarm_intelligence/). We have created a central server that acts as the fusion center and is able to classify activities by fusing accoustic observations from multiple clients. 

Multiple devices can connect to the fusion center. Upon a request made by the central server clients will listen to the environment for a short timespan and transmit their observation of the environment back to the server. The server will then fuse all these observations and come up with an activity classification.
