# Overview

The SmartMesh SDK is a Python package which simplifies the integration of a SmartMesh IP or a SmartMesh WirelessHART
network into your application. It implements the Application Programming Interface (API) of the device it is connected
to. A set of sample applications are included in the SmartMesh SDK, allowing a programmer to quickly understand the API
and use it as part of a larger system.

# SmartMeshSDK Features

* **Complete API definitions**. Supports the full API of the SmartMesh IP Manager, SmartMesh IP Mote, SmartMesh
WirelessHART Manager, and SmartMesh WirelessHART Mote. No need to copy-paste command definitions.
* **Low-level connectors**. Enables your application to connect to all Dust Networks devices, over all transport media,
including serial, XML-RPC and SerialMux. No need to develop low-level modules.
* **dustUI visuals library**. A set of standard GUI elements with a common look-and-feel which can easily be customized.
* **Full source code**. Delve into the inner-workings of the SmartMeshSDK.
* **Example applications**. Both GUI based, and script based. Provided in source code and binary formats.
* **Fully documented**. High level hands-on introduction guide, as well as Doxygen-based source code documentation.
* **Portable**. Does not require anything beyond a standard Python installation. Runs on any platform which supports
Python, including Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOS.
* **Extensible**. Is designed to be integrated inside a larger application.
