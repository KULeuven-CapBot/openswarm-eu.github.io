# Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a flocking controller for a swarm of robots that has range and bearing access to its neighboring robots.

It is based on the [Mie potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_potential), which involves attractive and repulsive forces. Each robot calculates virtual forces with its neighbors, which results in an overall flocking behavior.
