## Abstract
Low-power wireless mesh networks provide a solution for the seamless wireless coverage of complex physical environments due to their ability to route around physical obstructions and sources of interference. For example, networks such as SmartMesh-IP, WirelessHART and 6TiSCH deliver industry-grade reliability with low routing power consumption. However, conventional low power mesh networks suffer from high latency. The root of this problem is the need to reduce receiver power consumption by duty cycling the radio receiver using time-synchronized wake-ups or preamble sampling. We tackle this problem by introducing **CaIN**, **a near field mesh network that transmits information using strong Capacitive and INductive effects** that can be detected by a passive receiver front end, thereby side-stepping the need for intermittent receiver usage. Given that near field effects are limited to a few wavelengths, we implement our proof-of-principle transceiver in the **VHF frequency band at 40 MHz**, achieving a unique performance profile including: **20 kbps link layer throughput**, **sub-ùúáW receiver power consumption**, **sub-ms wireless wake-up and 17 m per-hop range**. Building upon these properties, we realize a novel mesh network with a worst-case latency of under 40 ms for a 3 hop network. To promote replication and further work, we have made the hardware and software of our reference implementation open source.

## Project Structure
This repository is divided into multiple folders, each containing specific materials needed to replicate or extend the CaIN transceiver.

### Software
In the `Software` folder, you will find:

1. **CaIN_20131016Worked**  
   - This version does not use a front-end amplifier.  
   - The receiver is connected to the USB serial port of a laptop to continuously print the received data.

2. **CaINamp**  
   - This code configures the MCU to send and receive data as a transceiver for CaIN.  
   - After initialization, the MCU uses the RF switch to connect the antenna to the receiver front end, putting the transceiver into **receive mode**.  
   - In receive mode, the MCU attaches an interrupt handler to the RX pin and then goes into sleep mode. It wakes up upon receiving a CaIN message.  
   - When acting as a transmitter, the MCU drives the RF switch via a GPIO pin to connect the antenna to the transmitter front end, enabling **transmit mode**.
