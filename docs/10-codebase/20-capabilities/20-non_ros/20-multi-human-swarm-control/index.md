# Overview

This repository contains the swarm robot controllers and user interface for two users to interact with a swarm of simulated e-puck robots in ARGoS.

[ARGoS](https://www.argos-sim.info/) is used to simulate a swarm of [e-puck](https://e-puck.gctronic.com/) robots. We use a customized version of [Webviz](https://github.com/NESTLab/argos3-webviz), which is a web interface plugin for ARGoS. This allows multiple users to interact with the same simulation from different devices.

A pair of users can individually access the Webviz interface and work together to use the robot swarm to score points by performing simulated tasks. The user is presented with a first-person perspective view of the simulation environment and are able navigate the environment and send task-related signals to nearby robots.
