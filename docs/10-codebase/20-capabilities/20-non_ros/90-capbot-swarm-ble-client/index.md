# Overview

This repository contains the client side code for a CapBot (previously known as FreeBot) to communicate with other CapBots via a [central server](../100-capbot-swarm-ble-server/index.md) using BLE.

Also refer to [Capbot Swarm Swarmhack](../../../../20-noncodebase/10-enablers/20-non_ros/70-capbot-swarm-swarmhack/index.md) for more information.

>**NOTE**: The working example can currently be found in the ```work-and-charge``` branch. Make sure to ```git checkout work-and-charge``` when using the BLE-client.
