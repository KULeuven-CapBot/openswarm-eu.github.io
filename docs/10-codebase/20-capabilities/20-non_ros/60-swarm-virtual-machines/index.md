# Swarm Virtual Machines

**Description**: Library of virtual machines written in different programming languages (e.g. C/C++, Python, Arduino, Kilobot). Used by Nadzoru2.

* **Primary Functionality**: Virtual machines to run logic generated by Nadzoru2.
* **Target**: Multiple targets (MCUs, PCs)
* **Task**: T4.4
* **Responsible**: Genki Miyauchi

# Overview

The list below contains a library of virtual machines. The virtual machine is a piece of software that runs on a system (such as a robot) to exhibit the behavior defined using supervisory control theory (SCT), which is a formal approach for designing discrete event systems. 

When a user design SCT models using [Nadzoru2](../50-nadzoru2/index.md), it produces a set of supervisors that realizes the defined behavior. The user is then able to select a device or a programming language in Nadzoru2 that matches their system to execute the behavior. Once a device or programming language is seletced, Nadzoru2 generates a template source code contaning the set of supervisors along with the virtual machine. This ensures that the behavior will be executed as intended, while also reducing the amount of ad-hoc development required by the user.
