# Overview

This project realizes the Data Distribution Agent (DDA), a loosely coupled multi-agent system that enables unified and universal data-centric communication and collaboration in distributed and decentralized applications. Its main goal is to remove the inherent complexity in developing communication technologies for distributed systems by exposing Data-centric Communication as a Service to application developers in the form of a middleware without requiring in-depth knowledge of messaging protocols and communication networks. DDA is designed for universal data exchange, enabling human-to-human, machine-to-machine, or hybrid communication.

A DDA exposes a collection of application-level peripheral services that _abstract_ commonly used functionality in decentralized applications:

* data-centric communication over interchangeable messaging protocols
* distributed state synchronization based on consensus algorithms that guarantee strong consistency
* local persistent key-value storage

Application components that do not embed the DDA library directly can consume these services through modern open-standard APIs.

In addition, a DDA supports observability, i.e. the ability to measure and infer its internal state by analyzing [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) traces, logs, and metrics that it generates and exports.
